### How to play the game

To move a piece you can enter `move [starting position] [ending position]` where the positons are strings that contain a character followed by an integer. To determine the correct starting postion and ending position of your move, use the board's grid system.

For example `move c3 c4` moves the piece of c3 to c4.

To end the game, you can run `forfeit` when your player is prompted to make a move.
